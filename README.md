# Lassen 1915 Black Dacite Isentropic Decompression Modeling

## About
Hi! I'm Julia, a 4th-year undergraduate studying geophysics & geophysical engineering with a minor in geology at the Colorado School of Mines. This project explores how magma evolves as it ascends through the Earth's crust, using the historic 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak, California as a case study. I am using computational modeling to understand how different physical processing (degassing, crystallization, etc.) control the final composition.

This research is conducted under the guidance of Professor Wendy Bohrson in the Department of Geology and Geological Engineering.

## Research Question
How do different decompression pathways (varying degassing, eruption efficiency, and melt trapping) affect the compositional evolution and crystallinity of dacitic magma during ascent?

## Purpose 
Understanding magma ascent processes helps us:
- Predict eruption styles and explosivity
- Interpret volcanic rock compositions to reconstruct past eruptions
- Improve volcanic hazard assessments

## Methods
**Model:** [Magma Chamber Simulator (MCS)](https://mcs.geol.ucsb.edu/)

**Initial Composition:** Black dacite from 1915 Lassen eruption
- SiO₂: 63.4 wt%
- Starting conditions: 2500 bars (~10 km depth), 1200°C
- Final conditions: 50 bars (~0.5 km depth), ~767°C

**Parameters Explored:**
- **Fluid to Conduit (C):** Fraction undergoing equilibrium crystallization during ascent
- **Fluid Degassed (D):** Fraction losing volatiles through open-system degassing
- **Fluid to Pile (P):** Fraction trapped in cumulate pile
- **Volatile content:** H₂O (1-6 wt%), CO₂ (0-0.5 wt%)
- **Initial storage depth:** 2500-4000 bars

## Key Findings
[To be updated as analysis progresses]
