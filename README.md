# MCS-Lassen-Isentropic-Decompression
Hi, my name is Julia and I am doing a research project on isentropically decompressing the black dacite from Lassen's 1915 eruption. I will be using the Magma Chamber Simulator (MCS) for this project, which you can find more information about here: https://mcs.geol.ucsb.edu/. The main parameters I will be changing are the fluid to conduit, fluid degassed, and fluid to pile ratios as well as volatile (H2O and CO2) content, and initial system pressure. This repository will contain my notebooks, figures, and anything else relevant to the project. 

This research is done under the guideance of Professor Wendy Bohrson at the Colorado School of Mines in the Department of Geology and Geological Engineering.
