This folder will contain all the run data. File name formatting is dependent on the variables edited, but will always follow the form: "Lassen_{run_name}".

For changing the ratios of fluid to pile, fluid to conduit, and fluid degassed, the file will have the run name in the format: "CXX_DXX_PXX" where XX represents the percent contributing toward the ratio.
C represents to conduit, D represents degassed, and P represents to pile. For example C20_50_P30 would be 20% to conduit, 50% degassed, and 30% to pile.
